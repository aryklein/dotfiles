# dotfiles

This repository contains all my dotfiles managed with GNU Stow and some scripts to setup
my environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryklein/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

- `dotfiles.sh`: deploys or cleans my dotfiles.
- `vim-plug.sh`: installs or uninstalls vim-plug and manages plugins in Neovim.
- `zsh-setup.sh`: configures zsh.
